# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 02, 2023 
This is Day 0, I decided to start by revising my base knowldege in python by creating a random password generator.
Quickly realised my syntax needs brushing up, and a need to review some concepts. In the first try I managed to create a random number password generator that takes a length of the password from the user. The next step I want to have a mix of symbols and alphabet characters.

### Day 1: June 3, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Yesterday i realised i needed to k=learn more about the random module. So today i have gone in to look at some of the functions in the module. They are many, but i purpose to work through atleast 10 of them. Today i handled 5 functions and understood them well. Tomorrow i will continue with more five

**Thoughts**: It was a struggle to get my head around what each does withouth mixing them up, but finally their names made sense and helped me understand them.

### Day 2: June 4, Sunday 2023

**Today's Progress**: I have continued to look at the random module. Specifically the choices(), getrandbits(), randint(), seed(), and random().

**Thoughts** It was interesting observing the similarities and difference between choice() from yesterday and choices() and learning about the optional parameter weght, cum_weight which were really confusing but through experimenting with them i got a hang of them.
