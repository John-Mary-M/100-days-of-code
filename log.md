# 100 Days Of Code - Log

Day 0: June 02, 2023 

This is Day 0, I decided to start by revising my base knowldege in python by creating a random password generator.
Quickly realised my syntax needs brushing up, and a need to review some concepts. In the first try I managed to create a random number password generator that takes a length of the password from the user. The next step I want to have a mix of symbols and alphabet characters.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
