# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 02, 2023
This is Day 0, I decided to start by revising my base knowldege in python by
creating a random password generator.
Quickly realised my syntax needs brushing up, and a need to review some concepts
. In the first try I managed to create a random number password generator that
takes a length of the password from the user. The next step I want to have a mix
of symbols and alphabet characters.

### Day 1: June 3, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Yesterday i realised i needed to k=learn more about the
random module. So today i have gone in to look at some of the functions in the
module. They are many, but i purpose to work through atleast 10 of them. Today i
handled 5 functions and understood them well. Tomorrow i will continue with more
five

**Thoughts**: It was a struggle to get my head around what each does withouth
mixing them up, but finally their names made sense and helped me understand them.

### Day 2: June 4, Sunday 2023

**Today's Progress**: I have continued to look at the random module.
Specifically the choices(), getrandbits(), randint(), seed(), and random().

**Thoughts** It was interesting observing the similarities and difference
between choice() from yesterday and choices() and learning about the optional
parameter weght, cum_weight which were really confusing but through
experimenting with them i got a hang of them.

### Day 3 and 4: June 5 - 6, 2023

**Progress**: The semester started on high note. Wasnt suprised but the projects
came from a totally unexpected perspective
Projects from class kept me busy good thing they were python related. I learnt
about compiling py scripts in a Linux enviroment
, pycodestle, fstrings, string formaters, functions, and i was introduced to
control flow.

**Thoughts**: It has not been an easy past 2 days, at a point it felt like i was
not understanding anything, but managed to complete the tasks.
Class work requires a very different mind set and approach to python I wasnt yet
in. But now starting to get a hang of.

### Day 5: June 7, Sunday 2023

**Today's Progress**: Today I wwent back to review Singly linked Lists in C
before i meet them again in python

**Thoughts**: Going back to basics was a bitter pill, but after some time in
revision, I found it worthwhile.I still have to review appending to the list,
inserting, and deleting from the list.

### Day 6: June 8, Thursday 2023

**Today's Progress**: On day 0 I wrote a program that generates a random
password for the user, in that program i import the random module. Today
was all about understanding how modules work, both in-built and custom modules.
I learnt the different ways to import, prefered standards, the dir(), and the
sys module.

**Thoughts**: The manuals are initimidating to read. But once i started taking
them bit by bit with the help of youtube videos for concepts that didnt make
sense right away like namespaces and scopes, everyth started to fall into place.
